## For this apartment search project, we leveraged NYC Open Data and Zillow datasets, incorporating NYC zip code shapefiles, Zillow's monthly rent averages, and historical data on 311 complaints and the 2015 tree census. The datasets underwent a meticulous cleaning process to handle missing values, standardize formats, and ensure compatibility. Using the SQLAlchemy library, we created a relational database, defining tables for each dataset and establishing relationships. Subsequently, we inserted cleaned data into the respective tables. To answer key questions about neighborhoods and housing trends, we formulated SQL queries, extracting valuable insights about rent averages, complaint counts, and greenery levels. Visualizations were then generated using matplotlib to enhance the interpretability of the results, providing a comprehensive analysis for informed decision-making in the quest for a suitable apartment.
